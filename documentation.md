# Algorithmic Insurance Premium Calculator Codelab

This codelab provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the Algorithmic Insurance Premium Calculator application. This application is designed to calculate insurance premiums for algorithmic insurance contracts, specifically focusing on medical malpractice lawsuits arising from errors in machine learning algorithms used for malignant tumor detection. By the end of this codelab, you will understand the application's functionality, key parameters, and the underlying concepts.

## Introduction

Duration: 00:05

Algorithmic insurance is a relatively new field that aims to provide financial protection against the risks associated with using AI and machine learning in critical applications. One such application is in healthcare, where algorithms are increasingly used to detect diseases like cancer. However, these algorithms are not perfect and can make mistakes, leading to potential lawsuits and financial losses.

This application helps to quantify these risks and calculate a fair insurance premium based on factors like the accuracy of the algorithm, the cost of litigation, and the number of patients affected. Understanding the trade-offs between these factors is crucial for both insurance providers and healthcare organizations. This codelab will walk you through the application's features and explain the key concepts involved.

## Setting up the Environment

Duration: 00:10

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

*   **Python 3.6 or higher:** The application is built using Python.
*   **Streamlit:** The user interface is built using Streamlit. Install it using `pip install streamlit`.
*   **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation. Install it using `pip install pandas`.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations. Install it using `pip install numpy`.
*   **Scikit-learn:** Used for training the machine learning model. Install it using `pip install scikit-learn`.
*   **Matplotlib:** Used for creating visualizations. Install it using `pip install matplotlib`.

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):** If the code is hosted on a repository, clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the application files.
3.  **Install dependencies:** Run `pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib` to install the required libraries.

## Running the Application

Duration: 00:02

To run the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```console
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser.

## Exploring the User Interface

Duration: 00:05

The application has a simple and intuitive user interface built using Streamlit. The main components are:

*   **Sidebar:**  Located on the left, it contains the navigation and input parameters.
*   **Main Panel:**  Displays the calculated premium, sensitivity analysis, and other relevant information.

The sidebar allows you to navigate between the "Premium Calculator" and "Documentation" pages. The main panel will dynamically update based on your selection.

## Premium Calculator Page

Duration: 00:15

The "Premium Calculator" page is the core of the application. It allows you to input various parameters and calculate the insurance premium.

### Input Parameters

The following input parameters are available:

*   **Litigation Cost (False Negative) - L:** The cost of litigation resulting from a false negative (i.e., the algorithm fails to detect a malignant tumor). This is a crucial factor in determining the premium.
*   **Litigation Cost (False Positive) - K:** The cost of litigation resulting from a false positive (i.e., the algorithm incorrectly identifies a benign tumor as malignant).  While typically lower than false negative costs, this still contributes to the overall risk.
*   **Number of Patients (N):** The number of patients covered by the insurance contract.  A larger number of patients naturally increases the potential for errors and lawsuits.
*   **Contract Price Upper Bound (Hp):**  This parameter is currently not utilized in the premium calculation but acts as a constraint on maximum price.
*   **Classification Threshold (τ):** The threshold used by the algorithm to classify a patient as having a malignant tumor.  Adjusting this threshold affects the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm, and therefore the overall risk.

**Explanation of Parameters' Impact:**

*   Increasing the litigation costs (L or K) will increase the calculated premium.
*   Increasing the number of patients (N) will increase the calculated premium.
*   Changing the classification threshold (τ) will affect the sensitivity and specificity of the model, which in turn will impact the number of false positives and false negatives, and ultimately the premium.

### Synthetic Data Generation

The application generates synthetic data to simulate patient data. This data includes features related to tumor characteristics and a "malignant" label indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

```python
def generate_synthetic_data(num_samples=1000):
    data = {
        'radius_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 20,
        'texture_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 30,
        'perimeter_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 150,
        'area_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 1200,
        'smoothness_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 0.2,
        'compactness_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 0.4,
        'concavity_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 1,
        'concave points_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 0.2,
        'symmetry_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 0.4,
        'fractal_dimension_mean': np.random.rand(num_samples) * 0.1,
        'malignant': np.random.choice([0, 1], num_samples, p=[0.6, 0.4])
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df
```

A sample of the generated data is displayed in a Streamlit dataframe.

### Model Training

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the synthetic data to predict whether a tumor is malignant. This model is used to estimate the probabilities of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

```python
X = df.drop('malignant', axis=1)
y = df['malignant']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

<aside class="positive">
The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility of the results.  For production systems, more sophisticated model selection and validation techniques would be required.
</aside>

### Premium Calculation

The premium is calculated based on the expected loss due to false positives and false negatives. The formula is:

`Expected Loss = (FN / Total) * L + (FP / Total) * K`

Where:

*   `FN` is the number of false negatives.
*   `FP` is the number of false positives.
*   `Total` is the total number of patients.
*   `L` is the litigation cost for false negatives.
*   `K` is the litigation cost for false positives.

The total estimated premium is then:

`Total Premium = N * Expected Loss`

```python
def calculate_premium(L, K, N, tau, model, X_test, y_test):
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
    predictions = (probabilities >= tau).astype(int)

    tp = np.sum((predictions == 1) & (y_test == 1))
    tn = np.sum((predictions == 0) & (y_test == 0))
    fp = np.sum((predictions == 1) & (y_test == 0))
    fn = np.sum((predictions == 0) & (y_test == 1))

    expected_loss = (fn / len(y_test)) * L + (fp / len(y_test)) * K
    total_expected_loss = N * expected_loss

    return total_expected_loss

premium = calculate_premium(litigation_cost_false_negative, litigation_cost_false_positive, num_patients, classification_threshold, model, X_test, y_test)
```

The calculated premium is displayed in the application.

### Sensitivity Analysis

A sensitivity analysis is performed to show how the premium changes as the classification threshold (τ) varies. This helps to understand the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

```python
thresholds = np.arange(0.1, 1.0, 0.05)
premiums = [calculate_premium(litigation_cost_false_negative, litigation_cost_false_positive, num_patients, t, model, X_test, y_test) for t in thresholds]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(thresholds, premiums)
ax.set_xlabel("Classification Threshold (τ)")
ax.set_ylabel("Estimated Premium")
ax.set_title("Premium vs. Classification Threshold")
st.pyplot(fig)
```

A plot of premium versus classification threshold is displayed. By examining this plot, you can understand the impact of the classification threshold on the estimated premium.

Duration: 00:15

You can modify the application to experiment with different parameters, models, and data. Here are some ideas:

*   **Change the synthetic data generation:** Modify the `generate_synthetic_data` function to create more realistic or complex datasets.  Consider adding correlations between features.
*   **Experiment with different machine learning models:** Try using different classification algorithms from scikit-learn, such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines. Compare their performance and impact on the calculated premium.
*   **Add more features to the model:** Include additional features in the synthetic data and use them to train the model.  Consider features beyond basic tumor characteristics.
*   **Implement more sophisticated risk measures:**  Explore using CVaR or VaR to calculate the premium instead of just expected loss.
*   **Incorporate real-world data:**  If available, replace the synthetic data with real-world patient data to get more accurate premium estimates.  Ensure proper data privacy and ethical considerations.
